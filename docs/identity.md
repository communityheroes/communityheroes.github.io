Mission and values[](#mission-and-values)

---------------------------------------------

**Community Heroes aims to** Create an environment of community and purpose. We strongly believe that open and inclusive communities can engage people and organizations in meaningful, diverse and fun connections and help them become better versions of themselves.

**Community Heroes' values** are like its DNA, an intrinsic and stable part of its identity. If you have joined the CH team , then you must agree with these values since we used them as a evaluation criteria to onboard you ;). Read, reread and rereread them. They are key. You will find them in our meeting check-ins, in our debriefings, as a tool to make decisions and transformed into competencies you need to have in your integration evaluation.

-   **Respect** : Respecting others means to listen to their opinions and to value their actions, even if we don't agree with them. It also means that we respect each other's time and feelings when working together. Respecting the environment means to think about the impact our actions have on the environment as a whole including on animals and plants.

-   **Openness**: Openness means taking down the barriers that constrain communication, decision making, collaboration, and ideas sharing. By being more open, we can strengthen the relationships within communities and build bridges to facilitate the exchange between cultures.

-   **Fun**: fIt is important to us that we as individuals have fun working together on the project, and that our users have fun engaging with our application. Having fun means to not take things too seriously, to able to laugh, share jokes, and build positive relationships. It is just as important that we celebrate our successes as it is that we learn from our failures.

-   **Responsibility**: As a company and as individuals, we are responsible for our actions. Being responsible means that we ensure that our actions do not harm, or in any other way negatively impact, our teammates, our communities, our partners, and our planet.
