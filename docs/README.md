# Community Heroes Guidebook
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### A guidebook to help all team members understand Community Heroes mission, values and way of work**

*Note: This is largely inspired (copied) from the public Guidebook made by Euforia.org (We thank them so much). We share the vision and the ambition to be a teal organization and their guidebook is a very detailed and practical set of documents to do it. So we started from there and we'll make it more our own in the future (Community Heroes is quite a young company :))*

Hey there! 
If you're reading this, it means that either you're part of the Community Heroes team or you're lost and found this page by mistake. In both case, you're welcome to keep reading :) 

## The beginning

During your onboarding, you will have a session with one of the co-founder, introducing you how we work and giving you advice about how you could best integrate to the team. At the end of the call you'll be asked: « Did you understand everything ? Is everything clear ? » And you will be like « Oh yes! a lot of stuff but I mean I can make it » while really thinking « Oh my #####, what the f#### ? ». And then of course the kind responsible will be like: « If you have any questions feel free to ask, we are here to help you (« smile »)» and you will answer « Yes of course ! I will don’t you worry ! » but actually you are like « Well I can sort it out. I mean there’s Google ».Come on, we ALL do that (even if we don’t want to admit it).
However, there are stuff you can't find in Google... and a company structure and culture's details are one of them :) So really, we are here to help so don't hesitate to ask! 
Also, we tried to summarize everything in this guidebook which means that all the questions that might pop-up in your head regarding Community Heroes structure, strange vocabulary, weird meetings, strange people, ways to work, all this…(you know) you’ve got all the answers compiled in a one and only document. Hallelujah !
