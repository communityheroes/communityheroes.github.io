Role definition and allocation[](#role-definition-and-allocation)

=====================================================================

As explained [here](/guidebook/organization/self-management/structure/roles), at Community Heroes we have roles instead of fixed job descriptions and we use [glassfrog](https://app.glassfrog.com/organizations/23039/orgnav/roles/12945438) instead of a regular organigram and job descriptions.

# Role definition
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**In general**, the lead link of each circle holds its purpose is responsible for ensuring that the appropriate roles exist for the purpose to be realized and that there is a good fit between the roles and the people. In pratice, these discussions and any decisions are generally held with all (or most of) the circle members, during governance meetings.

How are roles allocated?[](#how-are-roles-allocated)

--------------------------------------------------------

Well, normally when you applied for a position at Community Heroes, the roles you would be responsible for were clearly described and this is how you obtained your first roles.

After, your roles may evolve as new needs arise and roles appear, or if you want to evolve professionnally. The spaces to discuss how you would like to evolve your roles at Community Heroesare the 1:1 or annual evaluation or informally with your team mates, and the place to decide/officialise role reallocations are governance meetings.

In practice, quite a few role allocations and changes happen informally, in discussion with the lead links.

How are roles defined?[](#how-are-roles-defined)

----------------------------------------------------

Each lead link is responsible for making sure the roles are clearly defined. He/she can decide how the role definition happens and who does it. Subsequent changes to the role definitions are generally made or decided during governance meetings.
