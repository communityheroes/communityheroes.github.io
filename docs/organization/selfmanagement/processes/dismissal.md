Potential dismissal process[](#potential-dismissal-process)

===============================================================

When hiring someone new to join our team, it's important to be aware that our working culture is not a good match to everyone. Approximately once a year since Community Heroes started having employees, someone has been dismissed. Because of our human centered culture and the fact that the people we work with are not only colllegues but also friends, the longer the person has been part of the team, the more difficult it is to go through a dismissal process (believe it, we know from experience!!).

From this experience comes the first and most important principle: ***"hire fast, fire fast!".*** The objective is to NEVER AGAIN have to fire someone that has been in the team beyond their trial period.

Key principles for *hire fast fire fast* to function well[](#key-principles-for-hire-fast-fire-fast-to-function-well)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Don't talk about people behind their back!

-   Each circle takes the lead on deciding who to hire and integrate, using the advice process.

-   The newbie has an integration coach to support his/her integration. Whoever is an integration coach should have been at Community Heroes for 6-12 months.

-   An integration team is formed with the 3 people who will work most with the newbie. The integration team should ideally be present for entire integration period (at least! or even 6-12 months longer).

-   The decision whether the new person can stay beyond the integration period or not is taken within the integration team based upon peer evaluation.

-   The process transparent to the person hired from day 1. Clearly say to the newbie that we *hire fast and fire fast*.

-   Talent development role is present to ensure the process is respected and as support to the integration team upon request (tools explanations, mediation, advice...).

-   All evaluations in trial period and any other important communication/meeting is done in written form.

-   Past experience has shown us that is the person is underperforming in the following areas in the first 1-3 months, then the person will not do well at Community Heroes in the long term: leadership, goal oriented working attitude and (to a certain extent) following internal Community Heroes rules. **Take these indicators seriously!!!**
