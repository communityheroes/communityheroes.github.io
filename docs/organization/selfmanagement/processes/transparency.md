# Internal communication > absolute transparency[](#internal-communication-greater-than-absolute-transparency)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All employees get access to the "Community Heroes shared" drive folder that contains ALL information about Community Heroes, even people's salaries, our finance and performance evaluations. We switched to slack also to provide more transparency than previously existed with emails, since in general anyone can join any slack channel, apart from those made "closed" for a good reason.

Why? Laloux explains it superbly (pp110-111):

"The way information flows illustrates how assumptions (conscious or unconscious) shape organizational practices. In most workplaces, valuable information goes to important people first and then trickles down to the less important.

In Teal organizations, they are no unimportant people. Everybody expects to have access to all the information at the same time. It's a « no secret » approach.

3 reasons make this practice compelling for self-managing organizations:

1.  In the absence of hierarchy, self-managing teams need to have all the information available to make the best decisions.

2.  Any information that isn't public will cause suspicion (why else would someone go through the trouble to keep it secret?) and suspicion is toxic for the organization's trust.

3.  Informal hierarchies emerge when some people are in the know while others not."

Around two years ago we have moved to Slack in order to improve even further our transparency so that everyone has access to all conversation and information at any given time.

**Limits to this near absolute transparency at Community Heroes:**

-   **Not all volunteers get access to the entire drive**, only employees and a few volunteers.

-   We have a Community Heroes **confidential drive** with employees personal info (it's a legal requirement to keep this confidential) and some other stuff (accounting, salary sheets... Our salaries policy will be transparent though).

-   We will probably have in the future some group of people requiring a degree of confidentiality (Firing, legal decisions...)
