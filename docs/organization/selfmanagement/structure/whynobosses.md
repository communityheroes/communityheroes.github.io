**Why no bosses or managers?**[](#why-no-bosses-or-managers)

================================================================

Hierarchy with layers of (senior) managers is great for maintaining predictability and repeatability. It simplifies planning and makes it easier to control a large group of people from the top down, which is why military organizations rely on it so heavily.

In contrast "the world has become one giant network where instantly accessible and shareable information rewrites the future as quickly as it can be understood. Fueled by relentless technological innovation, this accelerating connectivity has created an ever increasing rate of change. As a result, the future is becoming increasingly difficult to predict.

Meanwhile, most organizations still rely on a way of working designed over 100 years ago for the challenges and opportunities of the industrial age. Team structures support routine and static jobs. Siloed, command and control systems enable senior leadership to drive efficiency and predictability at the expense of free information flow, rapid learning, and adaptability.

**The tension between organizations optimized for predictability and the unpredictable world they inhabit has reached a breaking point." (**[**Responsive Org Manifesto**](http://www.responsive.org/manifesto/)**)**

This is one of the key motivations for **Community Heroes' non-hierarchical organisational model. This does NOT mean our structure is flat.** Not everyone has the same influence or amount of decisional power, but each can decide for him/herself within his/her roles. An informal hierarchy emerges according to the knowledge and experience of the person within the organization.
