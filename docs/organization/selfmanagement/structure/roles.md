## Roles instead of fixed job descriptions

So if you've worked in a large traditional company or organization, you know all about fixed job descriptions like CEO (Chief Executive Officer), CFO (Chief Finance Officer), COO (Chief Operational Officer). At Community Heroes, we feel this is too limiting, cos what if you want to be CFO *and* a trainer *and* build partnerships? And what if after a few years you get tired of being CFO but want to keep your other responsibilities and take up fundraising? Well, here's the secret: you can! This is the beauty of granular, evolving roles.

At Community Heroes people choose, exchange and change roles according to time, interests and the needs of the organisation. It creates happiness at work and space for continuous professional development for the individuals as well as fluidity and adaptability for the organisation.
