**Self management is NOT no management**. Self-management at Community Heroes functions thanks to an interlocking system of structures and processes, detailed in the next chapters.

**Advantages of self management:**

-   People are generally happier when they have control over their own life (and work).

-   It doesn't make a lot of sense to give the decision-making authority to the person that furthest (literally) away from the actual work being done.

-   When you give good people more responsibility, they tend to flourish.

-   The traditional hierarchical model of organizations is not scalable - in fact, it's a recipe for a slow painful death. So as Community Heroes grows and more and more project are arising from different sides, this structure make us able to achieve our purpose more freely and fast. It helps to enable the work of employees and volunteer to be more effective, easy and flexible to follow and to be part of.
